#If Homebrew doesn't use a Github token, the API requests (used for brew search, brew install, ...) are limited by the IP
#shared with your co-workers. Non-authenticated API requests are very limited, so you should think about 
#generating a Github Token here: https://github.com/settings/tokens and uncomment the following line:
#export HOMEBREW_GITHUB_API_TOKEN=xxxx
